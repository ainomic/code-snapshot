# Security Policy

We take the security of `code-snapshot` seriously. If you have discovered a security issue in our project, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

## Reporting Security Issues

We request you to **not** report security issues through GitHub issues or public forums. Doing so may put other users at risk, or unnecessarily expose our project to malicious attacks.

Instead, if you find a security vulnerability, please send an email to our security team at contact@ainomic.com. Please include the following information:

- Detailed description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce the issue, if possible
- Your contact details for further communication

Our security team will review your email and work with you to address the issue. We appreciate your patience, as security responses can sometimes take time.

## Policy

If a security issue is confirmed, we will:

- Work on a fix for the issue
- Prepare a security advisory explaining the issue and steps users can take to protect themselves
- If necessary, coordinate with package distributors and downstream users to ensure the fix is widely available

Our goal is to handle the issue quickly and ensure our codebase remains safe for everyone. We appreciate your help in protecting `code-snapshot` and its users.
